SISYPHUS

Sisyphus is a framework for creating event-centric network applications.

At its core is the AnyEvent library. It tries to abstract away all socket
handling code. The developer specifies a protocol (or uses an existing 
protocol module), and couples that with an application module, which is
passed discrete message bodies as created by the protocol handler.

Sisyphus is very much in early development status, but is good enough for
development and shows promise. 

INSTALLATION

This installation requires a working compiler such as Debian/Ubuntu build-essential

This module requires Module::Install for installation. If you don't have 
it, you can install it with:

        sudo cpan Module::Install

To install Sisyphus, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	sudo make install

Module::Install can go to cpan to satisfy any unmet dependencies. If you'd
rather do that by hand, a list of dependencies exists at the top of 
Makefile.PL.

A note on installing EV: on Ubuntu 9.04 and 9.10, at least, installation 
FAILS if you answer:

	Skip further questions and use defaults (y/n)? [y] (ANSWER NO)

with the affirmative. Answer 'n' (NO), then accept all the defaults until

	Enable inotify support (y/n)? [y] (ANSWER NO)

where you should answer with an "n" (unless you have the proper libs installed). 
The remaining default answers are fine.

You should also enable network logging on your syslog. On Ubuntu 9.10, edit 
/etc/rsyslog.conf and uncomment the lines:

	# provides UDP syslog reception
	$ModLoad imudp
	$UDPServerRun 514

	# provides TCP syslog reception
	$ModLoad imtcp
	$InputTCPServerRun 514
