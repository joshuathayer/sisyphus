Sisyphus is a framework for creating event-centric network applications.

At its core is the AnyEvent library. It tries to abstract away all socket
handling code. The developer specifies a protocol (or uses an existing 
protocol module), and couples that with an application module, which is
passed discrete message bodies as created by the protocol handler.

Sisyphus is very much in early development status, but is good enough for
development and shows promise.
